<h1>About me</h1>

<p>There is no true model to save your data, just some useful ones. Those ones are our main goal: find a model that
can be useful for your problem. In this webapp, I can help you find this model by providing a simple interface to
train a model, explore the basics of it and finally score some test data.</p>

<p>It constitutes an end-to-end example to approach a real-world text mining example. For now, just unsupervised models
are used here, but this webapp could be easily tailored for supervised ones.</p>

<p>Please, feel free to play with this experiment, improve it and learn a lot from it!</p>

    tears in rain. Time to die.</p>

<p>Oh! I did not introduce myself: I'm a replicant. Just a replicant. Tears in the rain. Time to learn.
